(HW\#13)}

    \textbf{1.} Suppose $F$ and $G$ are differentiable functions on $[a,b]$,
$f=F'$, and $g=G'$. Prove that if $f$ and $g$ are Riemann integrable,
then
\[\int_a^b F(x)g(x) \,dx = F(b)G(b) - F(a)G(a) - \int_a^b f(x)G(x)\,dx.\]

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} \emph{Lemma.} If $T:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be
differentiable and $t\equiv T'$ is integrable. Then
\[\int_a^b t(x) \,dx = T(b) - T(a).\]

First, we prove this lemma. Let $P$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, which
means $P = \{x_0=a,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},x_n=b\}$, where $x_i < x_j$ if
$i < j$. By the mean value theorem, in each $i$ ($0\le i < n$), we have
$T(x_{i+1})-T(x_i) = (x_{i+1}-x_i)T'(c_i)$ for some
$c_i \in (x_i,x_{i+1})$. So
\[T(b) - T(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(T(x_{i+1})-T(x_i) ) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_i)t(c_i).\]

Hence we have $L(t,P) \le T(b) -T(a) \le U(t,P)$ for all $P$. By the
integrability of $t$, we conclude that
\[\int_a^b t(x) \,dx = T(b) - T(a).\]

Return to our problem, put $H=FG$, then $H$ is differentiable and
$H'=F'G+FG' = fG + Fg$. Show that $H'$ is integrable. Then use that
above lemma for $H$ to get the conclusion. $\Box$

    \textbf{2.} Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and differentible
on $(a,b)$. Assume $f(a) = 0$, $f(b) = -1$, and $\int_a^bf(x)\,dx = 0$.
Prove that there is a $c\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} Using the mean value theorem, show that
$f(a) = f(d) = 0$ for some $d\in (a,b)$. Apply the mean value theorem
one more time to get the conclusion. $\Box$

    \textbf{3.} Let $f_k$ be a sequence of bounded (Riemann) integrable
functions defined on $[a,b]$. Suppose $f_k \to f$ uniformly. Then prove
that $f$ is (Riemann) integrable on $[a,b]$, and
\[\int_a^b f_k(x)\,dx \to \int_a^b f(x) \,dx.\]

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} First, show that $f$ is continuous on
$[a,b] \backslash E$ with $E$ has measure zero. Use Theorem 3. $\Box$

    \textbf{4.} Find functions $f_k :[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ which are
integrable and such that $f_k \to f$ pointwise, but $f$ is not
integrable.

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} We may suppose $[a,b] = [0,1]$ for simplicity.
Let $f:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(0) = 0$ and $f(x) = 1/x$
for $x\in (0,1]$. For each $k$, put $f_k:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be
defined by $f(x) = k^2x$ for $x\in [0,1/k)$ and $f(x) =1/x$ for
$x\in [1/k,1]$. $\Box$

    \textbf{5.} Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and set
$F(x) = \int_0^{x^2} f(y)\, dy$. Prove $F'(x) = 2xf(x^2)$.

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} Put $G(x) = \int_0^x f(y)\,dy$. Use the
fundamental theorem of calculus. $\Box$

    \textbf{6.} Let $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, \[f(x) = \begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } x\in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q},\\
\frac{1}{q}, & \text{if } x = \frac{p}{q},
\end{cases}\] where $p,q\ge 0$ with no common factor. Show $f$ is
integrable and compute $\int_0^1 f$.

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} In HW\#4, Problem 8.b, we already prove that
$f$ is continuous at irrational points and discontinuous at rational
points. Apply Theorem 3 to show $f$ is integrable. Then show that
$\int_0^1 f = 0$ (not trivial, by notice that
$\chi_{\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]}$ is not integrable). One way to show this
is to calculate $L(f,P)$ for a partition $P$. $\Box$

    \textbf{7.} For continuous function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
define $f_n(x) = n\int_x^{x+1/n}f(\xi)\,d\xi$ for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ Show
that $df_n(x)/d(x)$ exists even if $df(x)/dx$ does not, and that
$f(x) = \lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)$, and that convergence to the limit is
uniform when $f$ is uniformly continuous.

    \textbf{Sketch of proof.} Put $g(x) = \int_0^x f(\xi)\,d\xi$, then
$f_n(x) = n(g(x+1/n)-g(x))$ for all $n$. By mean value theorem,
$f_n(x)  =f(c_{x,n})$ for some $c_{x,n}\in (x, x+1/n)$. When $f$ is
uniformly continuous, note that $|c_{x,n} - x| < 1/n$ and $1/n$ does not
depend on $x$. $\Box$
