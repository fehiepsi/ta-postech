      "\n",
      "**Proof.** $(a)$ Suppose $f:A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is a Lipschitz map with constant $L$. If $L = 0$, then $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = 0$ for all $x,y \\in A$. So $f$ is a constant function, hence is uniformly continuous. Now, suppose $L > 0$. For $\\epsilon > 0$, we put $\\delta = \\epsilon /L$. Then for all $\\epsilon > 0$, if $\\|x - y\\| < \\delta$, then $\\|f(x) -f(y)\\|\\le L \\|x-y\\| < L\\epsilon/L = \\epsilon$. So $f$ is uniformly continuous.\n",
      "\n",

      "$(c)$ This question is already answered in HW#4. For the sum, yes. For the product, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "$(d)$ $(sum)$ Yes. We may use $\\epsilon-\\delta$ argument to solve this problem. However, here we will use Exercise 4.a. Suppose $f,g:A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ are two uniformly continuous functions. Let $\\{x_n\\}$, $\\{y_n\\}$ be two sequences in $A$ such that $(x_n-y_n) \\to 0$ as $n\\to \\infty$. By $f,g$ are uniformly continuous, we have $(f(x_n) -f(y_n)) \\to 0$ and $(g(x_n)-g(y_n)) \\to 0$ as $n\\to \\infty$. So $((f+g)(x_n) - (f+g)(y_n)) \\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. This shows that $f+g$ is also uniformly continuous.\n",
      "\n",
      "$(product)$ No. For example, let $f,g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = x$, $g(x) = \\sin(x)$. Clearly $f$ is uniformly continuous. Similar to Exercise 6.b, we have the function $g(x)=\\sin(x)$ is also uniformly continuous. But their product $(fg)(x) = x\\sin(x)$ is not uniformly continuous (see Exercise 6.d). $\\Box$"

      "**Proof.** Let $T$ be the temperature function restricted to a given great circle. We may consider $T$ as a continuous function from $[0,2\\pi]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ with $T(0) = T(2\\pi)$. Let $f:[\\pi ,2\\pi]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = T(x) - T(x-\\pi)$. Then we have $f$ is continuous, $f(\\pi) = T(\\pi) - T(0)$, and $f(2\\pi) = T(2\\pi) -T(\\pi) = T(0) - T(\\pi) = -f(\\pi)$. Without loss of generation, we may suppose that $f(\\pi) \\le 0$, hence $f(2\\pi) \\ge 0$. Because $f$ is continuous and $[\\pi, 2\\pi]$ is connected, we have $f([\\pi,2\\pi])$ is connected. So $[f(\\pi),f(2\\pi)]\\subset f([\\pi,2\\pi])$. In particular, by $0 \\in [f(\\pi),f(2\\pi)]$, there exists $a\\in [\\pi,2\\pi]$ such that $f(a) = 0$. This means that $T(a) = T(a-\\pi)$. The pair $a$, $a-\\pi$ corresponds to two antipodal points in this given circle, and they have the same temperature. $\\Box$"
